# Octoneer – Autonomous Vehicle by Team Octobots

**Octoneer** is an autonomous self-driving robot developed by **Team Octobots** for the **Mexico World Robot Olympiad (WRO) Future Engineers 2025** challenge.

This project focuses on building a modular, high-performance autonomous vehicle using:

- 🧠 **Raspberry Pi 5 (16GB)** as the main processing unit
- 🎥 **Studica Depth Camera** for perception and spatial awareness
- 🧭 **YDLidar X2S** for obstacle detection and trajectory refinement
- ⚙️ A custom control system with PID tuning, parking logic, and dynamic path planning
- 🧩 Modular architecture (vision, control, parking, navigation)
- 📦 ROS 2 or Python-based system (depending on final implementation)
- 📝 Clean documentation and Git-based workflow for teamwork and maintainability

> Our goal is to compete at the national level and qualify for the **WRO International 2026 in Singapore**.

Developed with ❤️ and caffeine by:
- Haziel Campos – Lead developer, perception & control systems
- Team Octobots – Mechanical design, strategy and integration

📁 This repository includes:
- Source code for perception, control, and navigation
- CAD references and hardware diagrams
- Trained models and test data
- Documentation and technical report (in `/docs`)
